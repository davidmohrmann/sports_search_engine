# Project Name
Sports Search Engine

## Installation

This python3 program is easy to use. From your terminal, run sports.py. This python
program created a table of rushing stats for the University of
Alabama during the 2015 season in the sports database. If you run sports-query.py,
this program will allow users to type in a player's name and retrieve the stats
he had during the season. The players.csv file shows the stats used in creating the
table in the database.
After completing this project, one will understand the fundamentals of Database Schema design;
understand basic SQL syntax allowing for:
the creation of tables,
the query for data,
the insertion of data.
